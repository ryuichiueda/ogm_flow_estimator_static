# Occupancy Grid Map Flow Estimator (Static Version)

Concise motion estimator on an occupied grid map with a static viewpoint, whose basic algorithm has been presented on a domestic conference. 
(I will present it in some international conference with some improvement.)

## How to use

This is a ROS 2 repository using [ros2_rust](https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust). The way of installation is based on the manual or `ros2_rust`.

### node and its interfaces

As the author is not used to `ros2_rust`, parameters and names of topics are fixed at present.

#### `flow_estimator`

* topic for subscribing
    * `/scan` (`sensor_msgs/LaserScan`): scan data from 2D LiDAR
* topic for publising
    * `/scan_map` (`nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid`): an occupancy grid map simply reflecting the latest scan
    * `/static_obstacle_map` (`nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid`): an occupancy grid map of static objects
    * `/estimaton_array` (`visualization_msgs/MarkerArray`): an occupancy grid map of estimated positions of moving objects
